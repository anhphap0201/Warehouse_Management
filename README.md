## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The system uses a well-structured relational database with the following key entities:

### Core Tables
- **users** - System user authentication and profiles
- **products** - Product catalog with categories and specifications
- **categories** - Hierarchical product categorization
- **warehouses** - Warehouse location and details management
- **stores** - Store/branch location management
- **suppliers** - Supplier information and contact details

### Purchase Order System
- **purchase_orders** - Main purchase order records
- **purchase_order_items** - Individual items within purchase orders
- **order_statuses** - Purchase order status tracking

### Inventory Management
- **stock_movements** - Complete audit trail of inventory changes
- **inventory_levels** - Current stock levels by warehouse
- **transfers** - Inter-warehouse transfer records

### Key Relationships
- Products belong to Categories (Many-to-One)
- Purchase Orders contain multiple Items (One-to-Many)
- Stock Movements track Product changes across Warehouses
- Users can create and manage Purchase Orders

## üîÑ API Endpoints

### Search Endpoints
The system provides real-time search functionality through AJAX endpoints:

```

GET /search/warehouses?q={query}        # Search warehouses  
GET /search/suppliers?q={query}         # Search suppliers
```

### Purchase Order Management

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### MVC Architecture
The system follows Laravel's MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

- **Models**: Handle data logic and database interactions
- **Views**: Blade templates for user interface rendering
- **Controllers**: Process user requests and coordinate between models and views

### Key Components

#### Controllers
- `PurchaseOrderController` - Manages purchase order lifecycle
- `ProductController` - Handles product CRUD operations
- `WarehouseController` - Manages warehouse operations
- `StoreController` - Handles store/branch management
- `SearchController` - Provides real-time search functionality

#### Models
- `PurchaseOrder` - Purchase order management with status tracking
- `PurchaseOrderItem` - Individual items within orders
- `Product` - Product catalog with category relationships
- `Warehouse` - Warehouse location and capacity management
- `StockMovement` - Inventory movement audit trail

#### Key Features Implementation
- **Real-time Search**: AJAX-powered search with jQuery
- **Dynamic Forms**: Interactive purchase order creation
- **Status Management**: Automated workflow for order processing
- **Inventory Tracking**: Comprehensive stock movement logging

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Setup
1. Configure your web server to point to the `public` directory
2. Set appropriate file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   ```
4. Optimize for production:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:cache
   php artisan route:cache
   php artisan view:cache
   composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
   ```

### Security Considerations
- Keep `.env` file secure and never commit to version control
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Implement proper backup strategies for database

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite to ensure system functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test types
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit

# Generate test coverage report
php artisan test --coverage
```
